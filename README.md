## Scaler Inquiry Bot
Scaler Inquiry Bot is an advanced AI-powered assistant designed to streamline and enhance the inquiry handling process for Scaler, a leading educational platform. This project leverages large language models (LLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a vector database to provide accurate, context-aware responses to user queries, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

## Features
Real-time Query Handling: Respond to user inquiries in real-time with precise and relevant information.
Contextual Understanding: Utilize LLM and RAG to understand and generate responses based on the context of questions.
Learning Capability: Improve over time through machine learning, adapting to new types of inquiries and user behavior.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use chat interface for smooth interaction.
Scalability: Designed to handle a large volume of queries simultaneously, making it ideal for high-traffic environments.
Integration: Easy integration with Scaler's existing systems and platforms.

## Technologies Used:
Large Language Models (LLM): Used Llama 3 LLM with 8 billion parameters  for advanced language understanding and generation.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combine retrieval of relevant documents with LLM to generate more accurate and informative responses.
Vector Database: Used FAISS for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
Frontend: Used Streamlit for a responsive and interactive user interface.
